## Research Program

My primary research focus is understanding how new forces may connect dark matter and ordinary matter.

![Example](img/research/FigureTableWeb.png)

The theoretical scaffolding of particle physics relates different experimental handles for testing these models. In turn, hints of new particles may first manifest themselves in astronomical observations not traditionally in the real of high-energy physics.

## Related Work

The pressing question that the Large Hadron Collider was built to answer is why the **Higgs boson** is so surprisingly light. The possible answers include ideas such as supersymmetry and extra dimensions/compositeness. While the so-called Higgs Hierarchy Problem remains a mystery, these ideas may find new life applied to our struggle to understand the **dark sector**.

## Prospective Students

Graduate students interested in working with me should [review these lectures](http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.04228).
