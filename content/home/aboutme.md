# Biography

I spend a lot of time thinking about dark matter.

I grew up in Los Angeles and studied math and physics at Stanford. I did masters degrees in Cambridge the IPPP at Durham, then completed my Ph.D at Cornell. After postdoc at UC Irvine, I am now an assistant professor at UCR.

I fell in love with physics after reading *The Physics of Star Trek* and continue to value science communication in its many forms.
